# MarbleMaze
Maze is a return to nostalgic childhood games with the use of modern technology. Marble Maze involves users controlling a rolling marble 
using the accelerometer and magnetometer in their smartphone to get the marble from the 
beginning of the maze to the end. Marble Maze will also change its appearance depending on 
its environment to create a fun and interesting color ambience, in which the light sensor will 
dictate whether the maze’s background is black (in dark environments) or white (in bright 
environments). Additionally, the color of the marble itself will change according to the 
temperature of the user’s environment using the device’s ambient temperature sensor.
